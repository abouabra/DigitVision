## üìù Overview
Digit Vision is my interactive project that demonstrates how neural networks recognize handwritten digits. I built this to visualize the inner workings of convolutional neural networks and provide an educational tool for understanding machine learning concepts. Users can draw digits and see in real-time how each layer of the neural network processes the input, making complex AI concepts more accessible and intuitive.

## ‚ú® Key Features
- **Interactive Drawing Canvas**: Draw digits (0-9) and see instant predictions
- **Neural Network Visualization**: Explore activation maps from each convolutional layer
- **Confidence Metrics**: View prediction confidence levels for all possible digits
- **3D t-SNE Visualization**: Explore high-dimensional data in an interactive 3D space
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices
- **Real-time Processing**: Immediate feedback as you draw

## üîß Technical Stack

## üéì My Learning Journey
Through building Digit Vision, I gained valuable insights into:
- Training and optimizing convolutional neural networks for image recognition
- Techniques for extracting and visualizing intermediate activations in deep learning models
- Methods for implementing interactive web-based machine learning applications
- Approaches to dimensionality reduction for visualizing high-dimensional data
- Strategies for creating intuitive user interfaces for complex technical concepts
- The importance of providing visual feedback in educational AI tools

This project has significantly deepened my understanding of both the technical aspects of deep learning and the challenges of making these complex systems more transparent and understandable to users.
